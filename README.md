### Azure AI Search with .NET
This repository demonstrates how to integrate Azure AI Search into .NET applications, enabling intelligent, context-aware information retrieval and conversational experiences.

It provides examples of how to create and configure search indexes, load structured and unstructured data, and perform full-text, semantic, and hybrid queries using the Azure.Search.Documents SDK. The code also shows how to apply filters, sorting, and highlighting to refine search results, and how to use vector-based retrieval for advanced scenarios.
